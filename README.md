## Optimizations

This project was built to practice full-stack web development using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. While I could have added features such as authentication, user account creation, video updates, and comprehensive profile management, my primary goal was to attempt integrating a Node.js backend with a React frontend. For more advanced implementations and features, please check out my other projects on GitHub, where I have explored these functionalities in depth.

## Technology Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Flexbox, CSS Grid
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Deployment:** Render
